This blog is a place where I collect information relevant for my daily work with Plone systems.
Some of the material here might help some other people to do their work.

### Working environment
Warning: I'm using a heavily customized Plone 4.x environment.
So please be careful if you try to folllow these customizations.
Some of them might not work in your environment.
